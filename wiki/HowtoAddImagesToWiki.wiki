#summary How to add images to the wiki without putting them in the downloads section.

== Introduction ==

This requires the ability to do svn commits. If you can edit pages here, you should be able to do that.


== Details ==

 # Do *one* of the following:
  * Checkout the wiki from svn. From the command line, this is
   * `svn checkout https://heekscad.googlecode.com/svn/wiki HeeksCAD/wiki`
  * Checkout ALL of heekscad (not just the source). From the command line, this is
   * `svn checkout https://heekscad.googlecode.com/svn HeeksCAD`
 # Put your image in the folder HeeksCAD/wiki/images
 # Add it to svn, using `svn add <filename>`
 # Change its mime-type so that it will show up. For a PNG image:
  * `svn propset svn:mime-type image/png myimage.png`
 # Link to your image from a wiki page - use this url: 
  * _http://heekscad.googlecode.com/svn/wiki/images/myimage.png_
