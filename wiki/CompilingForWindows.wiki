#summary How to compile this project for Windows with MS VC++

=How to build HeeksCAD=

I used Windows XP.

Get Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition ( it's free ) Download the Open CASCADE installation.

Download the wxWidgets installation.

Set an environment variable called WXWIN to be C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7 or whereever wxWidgets installed to.

Edit C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\include\wx\msw\setup.h

change #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 0 to #define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 1
and change #define wxUSE_ODBC 0 to #define wxUSE_ODBC 1

Open and build C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\build\msw\wx_dll.dsw ( let VC2008 convert the projects )

Copy all the dlls that get made ( 20 of them like wxbase28d_net_vc_custom.dll ) from C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\lib\vc_dll to HeeksCAD ( the folder you checked out this project to ).

Open "HeeksCAD.sln" ( for VC2008), or "HeeksCAD VC2003.sln" (for VC2003 )

Press build.
==VC2003 and VC2005==

To use VC2003 or VC2005, run vc_retro.py ( you will need to install Python first ).

This will make .vcproj and .sln files for VC2003 and for VC2005.
