#summary How to compile this project for Windows with MS VC++

=How to build HeeksCAD=

I used Windows XP.

Get Microsoft Visual C++ 2008 Express Edition ( it's free ).

Download the Open CASCADE installation.

Download the wxWidgets installation.

Set an environment variable called WXWIN to be C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7 or whereever wxWidgets installed to. ( to set an evironment variable go to Control Panel, then System, then Advanced tab, then press "Environment Variables" button, then press "New" ).

Edit C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\include\wx\msw\setup.h
changing "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 0" to "#define wxUSE_GLCANVAS 1"
and changing "#define wxUSE_ODBC 0" to "#define wxUSE_ODBC 1"

Open C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\build\msw\wx_dll.dsw ( let VC2008 convert the projects ).
Change the configuration to "DLL Release" or to "DLL Debug" if you will be building HeeksCAD in Debug mode.
Press "Build Solution"

Copy 4 of the dlls that get made from C:\wxWidgets-2.8.7\lib\vc_dll to HeeksCAD ( the folder you checked out this project to ).

They are: wxbase28_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28_aui_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28_core_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28_gl_vc_custom.dll

or if you are building Debug

wxbase28d_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28d_aui_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28d_core_vc_custom.dll wxmsw28d_gl_vc_custom.dll

Open "HeeksCAD.sln"

Press "Build Solution"

If it builds OK, press "Start Debugging"


==VC2003 and VC2005==

To use VC2003 or VC2005, run vc_retro.py ( you will need to install Python first ).

This will make .vcproj and .sln files for VC2003 and for VC2005.
