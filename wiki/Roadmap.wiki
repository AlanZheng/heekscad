#summary Roadmap for the development of heekscad

= Introduction =

This document outlines the future plans for heekscad. It is currently very much a work in progress. Edits and discussions on forums are encouraged. At some point these things will be converted into issues in bug tracker.

All of the issues in bug tracker need to get taken care of. At the very least they should be inserted into this document under some milestone. Some things may need to be marked as do not fix, others are probably fixed, but there reporters have not verified them as so. Imho, these should be marked as fixed and they will just get rereported if they are not.

It isn't clear to me if we should start milestoning before or after 1.0. The following list is stuff I think needs to happen for 1.0. Earlier stepping stones may be advisable depending on how big this list gets and the interdependencies or infrastructure requirements that arise as a consequence. 

= 1.0? / M1? =

  # Verify current dxf import capabilities. Elliptic arcs may not work.
  # Dxf export is seriously behind import.
  # Svg import not working for some users under linux. (is this a fluke, probably need some sort of testing)
  # Get the new drawing functions to work. Flyout toolbars are done, just need more buttons.
  # Many of the drawing functions and editing functions do not work properly in other coordinate systems. Sketches need to have a plane defined, and all points being moved around should be projected onto that plane. 
  # Set some kind of maximum undo depth.
  # Garbage collector for HeeksObj's. Should be tied into the UndoEngine somehow as this is the only way objects every get deleted. 
  # Ellipses and Elliptic arcs should be different entities
  # Pretty symbolism for constraints.
  # New dimension object with 3 modes (horizontal,vertical,pythagorean) which can be reference to 2 HPoint objects and will follow them around.
  # Angle between lines dimension object

= M2 = 

  # Start making a new set of 3d primitives that have sketches instead of faces. Eventually we will work on converting the imported geometry into this form.

= Wishlist = 

  # Svg export
  # Linewidth and color from dxf and svg
  # Block and reference objects.
  # Constraint inference engine. (Infers constraints when loading non native file formats)
  # Allow transformations by non orthogonal matrices. Start with 2d stuff, then move to 3d
