Like mentioned before, i can provide you with a script, that does the installation of HeeksCAD and HeeksCNC on your Debian based OS.

I tested this script successfuly on K/Ubuntu 10.04, 12.04 and 13.04 in both architectures.

Before you ask, the script does ask you to do three things that the provided packages by Heeks.net are not able to do, sadly.

1.) Makes a directory in your home folder called HEEKSCAD where the source files are downloaded to (After the installation, it will be deleted by the script!).

2.) Builds the shared libraries to /usr/local/lib needed by HeeksCAD and HeeksCNC.

3.) Installs HeeksCAD ans HeeksCNC on your system and builds the packages to your home folder, so you can easily remove or instal them again if you want.


Download the script, take a look at it, change it if you want, make it executable and run it.

4.) Open the terminal and cd yourself in to the directory where you downloaded the srcipt.

5.) Make it executable with chmod +x INSTALL_HEEKS.bash and run it wit ./INSTALL_HEEKS.bash. DO NOT USE SUDO!.

6.) You will be asked a few things and prompted for your sudo password. After that you will see a lot of lines and you should wait about an hour. It will prompt you a second time for your sudo password

Why, because it takes about 30 to 45 minutes to build the oce libraries and after that we need sudo a few times more.

On K/Ubuntu 12.04 and newer you will have to install a library suiting your architecture. Look for it at pkgs.org

The libarary is called libboost-python1.40.0 or libboost-python1.42.0

You can use the debian binary package also, but if you are on K/Ubuntu you should take those from K/Ubuntu.
