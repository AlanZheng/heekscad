#summary A brief overview of the options under the digitizing menu.

= Introduction =
"snapping" as implemented in other applications (where the placement of one object is pulled toward a grid, or other object) is called digitizing in HeeksCAD.  The options for controlling it are found under the digitizing menu. 

Many of these options interact with each other producing complex, and sometimes confusing, behavior.

Some options only have behavior when moving entities, others have behavior when moving or drawing.

Below is a brief description of the options.

= Details =

*End*  Snap to the end points of a line or edge. 

*Intersection* Snap to the intersecting points of two lines or edges.

*centre* When enabled, will snap to the center of a circle when the cursor approaches the edge.

*midpoint* Doesn't seem to work.

*nearest* snaps to the nearest point of an existing entity.

*tangent* Allows drawing lines and moving objects tangent to others.

*radius for undefined circles*  I don't know what this does.

*coordinates* I don't fully understand this.  In most cases, it should be left on.  Turning it off will cause objects being dragged to snap to the coordinate system origin.  It can be turned off when drawing a sketch to allow snapping only to endpoints and not the grid or intermediate coordinates.  

*screen* I don't completely understand this one.  I believe it controls whether objects snap perpendicular to the plane of the screen.  If the view is set XY and screen is turned on.  A sphere at z=10 is moved over the sketch, the sphere snaps to the end-point with z=radius.  With screen turned off, the sphere is moved to the endpoint with z=endpoint z.


*grid size*  default: 1.  Controls the size of the onscreen grid.

*snap to grid* Snap to the on-screen grid whose size is controlled by the grid size option.  If 'snap to grid' is off, the grid will automatically subdivide by 1/10 as the user zooms in and out.  If 'snap to grid is on, the grid size remains fixed during zooming.

*autosolve constraints*  Turns on and off the autosolving of constraints. Refer to the GeometricConstraints page.
