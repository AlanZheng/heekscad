#summary How to use the geometric constraints solver
= Introduction =

HeeksCAD has a built in geometric constraints solver. Allowing you to make inaccurate sketches into perfect drawings. 


= Details =

First, there are a couple of options that make things a whole lot easier. In the options panel:

Go to digitizing, and turn on autosolve constraints.
Go to selection filter, and turn off sketches.

Now, you can use the line arc drawing tool to make a polygon. Pressing and holding 'a' while drawing allows you to insert an arc segment.

After drawing, you can select a segment by clicking on it. Dragging the points will move the edges of the polygon around. A right click brings up a context menu allowing you to add/remove constraints. The items in the context menu will change depending on what is selected. Ctrl clicking allows multiple things to be selected. 

1 line selected:
   horizontal,vertical,length
2 lines selected:
   parallel,perpendicular,colinear,equal length
1 arc selected:
   radius
2 arcs selected:
   concentric,equal radius
1 arc and 1 line selected:
   arc tangent to line

After setting the parameter based constraints(length or radius), you can now change the parameter in the properties pane. This will update the geometry automatically.
